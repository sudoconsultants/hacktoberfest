# SUDOxHacktoberfest

The OpenSource community collaboratively works on OpenSource software and resources to make it available for use, modification, and distribution with its original rights. Developers can update a program by debugging, removing unwanted errors or warnings, and fixing modules that aren’t working appropriately. They can also modify software that best fits their needs and control its distribution.

SUDOxHACKTOBERFEST is an initiative to support the OpenSource community in the global arena. The Hacktoberfest Event spearheaded by Digital Ocean gives contributors a global platform to come together and make the OpenSource community even better with their collaboration. 

Equitably, SUDO Consultants will enthusiastically be participating officially in Hacktoberfest 2021. With this, SUDO has decided to partake in this journey by extending marketing initiatives and programs through social media campaigns, advertisements, and various channels.

Alongside, SUDO expanded open lines by offering unlimited slots to open-source contributors, interested developers, and engineers, who a lot their busy time making the open-source possible by allowing us to use all these software at their most convenient time.

SUDO aims to contribute continuously by engaging in more collaborative efforts, and open-source initiatives to help expand and build the open-source community. These initiatives and synergy, are not only to shape the industry, but it has made possible all the innovation we see today, from startups to big enterprises.
